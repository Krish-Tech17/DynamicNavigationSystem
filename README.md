Dynamic Navigation System (Unity)
Overview
This project implements a dynamic, waypoint-based navigation system. The system enables users to navigate to selected destinations within a virtual environment while dynamically computing the shortest valid route,  handling primary and secondary pathways, and supporting multi-floor navigation.

Primary & Secondary Pathway Support
Calculates routes using Primary paths
Automatically falls back to Secondary paths when required
Context-aware path switching based on player location
Multi-Floor Navigation

Blocking & Feedback Mechanisms:
Visual and audio warnings when the user exits a valid route
Real-time alternative route suggestion
Runtime Path Recalculation

Navigation adapts dynamically when:
User deviates from the route
Path becomes invalid due to rules or blocks
No restart required-
